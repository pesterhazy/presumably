Onboarding new developers to ClojureScript teams is a joy, mostly. You get to talk about all the things that make it fun to write web apps in a Lisp. But when we get to the topic of REPLs - arguably the most LISP-y of topics - there's often an awkard pause. While ClojureScript REPLs are well-supported these days, it's far from obvious how they work - and how to get them to work.

In this post, my goal is to explain CLJS repls in a way that I would have liked someone to explain them to me when I was starting out. But most pressing question on the newcomer's mind is how to set up. So while understanding the concepts is the goal, the path I'm taking in the post will be a guid to setting up a working REPL using figwheel main. 

## Getting started

```
clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {seancorfield/clj-new {:mvn/version "0.8.4"}}}' -m clj-new.create figwheel-main playground.core -- --reagent

# Generating fresh figwheel-main project.
#    -->  To get started: Change into the 'playground.core' directory and run 'clojure -A:fig:build'
```

Well, that was easy enough!

```
mv playground.core playground # Strange name for a directory
cd playground
```

Let's do some chores

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/pe/prg/playground/.git/
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Init"
$ tree

```

As the autogenerated README tells us, we can now start a development enviroment as follows:

```
$ clojure -A:fig:build
** SNIP **
Opening URL http://localhost:9500
ClojureScript 1.10.520
cljs.user=>
```

After the "Opening URL http://localhost:9500" line, Figwheel will attempt to start a browser pointed at the local URL, which make take a few seconds. If this step fails, you can open the URL manually in a browser of you choice (Chrome, Firefox and Safari should all work). Although it's possible to open the URL in multiple browsers or tabs at once, at the beginning it's best to make sure only one tab opening the URL is open at the same time.

When you see `cljs.user=>`, you can start typing Clojure forms into the prompt. Try this and watch the background color of the page change:

```
cljs.user=> (set! (.-backgroundColor (.-style (js/document.querySelector "body"))) "#decade")
"#decade"
```
